# FFmpeg software encoding parameters
# Honestly, I have no idea what the optimal values would be.
# Play around with this :)

# Constant Rate Factor. Between 1 and 52. It allows QP to go up during motion and down with still image, resulting in constant perceived quality
# Higher value means more compression, but less quality
# If crf == 0, then use QP directly instead
# crf = 0

# Quantitization Parameter
# Higher value means more compression, but less quality
# If crf != 0, then this parameter is ignored
# qp = 28

# Minimum number of threads used by ffmpeg to encode the video.
# Increasing the value slightly reduces encoding efficiency, but the tradeoff is usually
# worth it to gain the use of more CPU cores for encoding. The ideal value is the lowest
# value that can reliably encode at your desired streaming settings on your hardware.
# min_threads = 1

# Allows the client to request HEVC Main or HEVC Main10 video streams.
# HEVC is more CPU-intensive to encode, so enabling this may reduce performance when using software encoding.
# If set to 0 (default), Sunshine will specify support for HEVC based on encoder
# If set to 1, Sunshine will not advertise support for HEVC
# If set to 2, Sunshine will advertise support for HEVC Main profile
# If set to 3, Sunshine will advertise support for HEVC Main and Main10 (HDR) profiles
# hevc_mode = 0

# Force a specific encoder, otherwise Sunshine will use the first encoder that is available
# supported encoders:
#   nvenc
#   amdvce # NOTE: alpha stage. The cursor is not yet displayed
#   software
#
# encoder = nvenc
