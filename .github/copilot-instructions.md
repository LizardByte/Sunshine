On Windows we use msys2 and ucrt64 to compile.
You need to prefix commands with `C:\msys64\msys2_shell.cmd -defterm -here -no-start -ucrt64 -c`.

Prefix build directories with `cmake-build-`.

The test executable is named `test_sunshine` and will be located inside the `tests` directory within
the build directory.

The project uses gtest as a test framework.

Always follow the style guidelines defined in .clang-format for c/c++ code.
