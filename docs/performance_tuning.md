# Performance Tuning
In addition to the options available in the [Configuration](configuration.md) section, there are a few additional
system options that can be used to help improve the performance of Sunshine.

## AMD

In Windows, enabling *Enhanced Sync* in AMD's settings may help reduce the latency by an additional frame. This
applies to `amfenc` and `libx264`.

## NVIDIA

Enabling *Fast Sync* in Nvidia settings may help reduce latency.
