## [0.17.0] - 2023-01-08
If you are running Sunshine as a service on Windows, we are strongly urging you to update to v0.17.0 as soon as
possible. Older Windows versions of Sunshine had a security flaw in which the binary was located in a user-writable
location which is problematic when running as a service or on a multi-user system. Additionally, when running Sunshine
as a service, games and applications were launched as SYSTEM. This could lead to issues with save files and other game
settings. In v0.17.0, games now run under your user account without elevated privileges.

### Breaking
- (Apps) Removed automatic desktop entry (Re-add by adding an empty application named "Desktop" with no commands, "desktop.png" can be added as the image.)
- (Windows) Improved user upgrade experience (Suggest to manually uninstall existing Sunshine version before this upgrade. Do NOT select to remove everything, if prompted. Make a backup of config files before uninstall.)
- (Windows) Move config files to specific directory (files will be migrated automatically if using Windows installer)
- (Dependencies) Fix npm path (breaking change for package maintainers)
### Added
- (macOS) Added initial support for arm64 on macOS through Macports portfile
- (Input) Added support for foreign keyboard input
- (Misc) Logs inside the WebUI and log to file
- (UI/Windows) Added an Apply button to configuration page when running as a service
- (Input/Windows) Enable Mouse Keys while streaming for systems with no physical mouse
