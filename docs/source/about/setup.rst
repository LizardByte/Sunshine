            sudo modprobe uinput

   #. Enable permissions for KMS capture.
         .. warning:: Capture of most Wayland-based desktop environments will fail unless this step is performed.

         .. note:: ``cap_sys_admin`` may as well be root, except you don't need to be root to run it. It is necessary to
            allow Sunshine to use KMS capture.

Usage
-----
#. If Sunshine is not installed/running as a service, then start sunshine with the following command, unless a start
   command is listed in the specified package `install`_ instructions above.

   .. note:: A service is a process that runs in the background. This is the default when installing Sunshine from the
      Windows installer. Running multiple instances of Sunshine is not advised.

   **Basic usage**
      .. code-block:: bash

         sunshine

   **Specify config file**
      .. code-block:: bash

         sunshine <directory of conf file>/sunshine.conf

      .. note:: You do not need to specify a config file.
         If no config file is entered the default location will be used.

      .. attention:: The configuration file specified will be created if it doesn't exist.

   **Start Sunshine over SSH (Linux/X11)**
      Assuming you are already logged into the host, you can use this command

      .. code-block:: bash

         ssh <user>@<ip_address> 'export DISPLAY=:0; sunshine'

      If you are logged into the host with only a tty (teletypewriter), you can use ``startx`` to start the
      X server prior to executing sunshine.
      You nay need to add ``sleep`` between ``startx`` and ``sunshine`` to allow more time for the display to be ready.

      .. code-block:: bash

         ssh <user>@<ip_address> 'startx &; export DISPLAY=:0; sunshine'

      .. tip:: You could also utilize the ``~/.bash_profile`` or ``~/.bashrc`` files to setup the ``DISPLAY``
         variable.

      .. seealso::

         See :ref:`Remote SSH Headless Setup
         <about/guides/linux/headless_ssh:Remote SSH Headless Setup>` on
         how to setup a headless streaming server without autologin and dummy plugs (X11 + NVidia GPUs)

#. Configure Sunshine in the web ui

   The web ui is available on `https://localhost:47990 <https://localhost:47990>`__ by default. You may replace
   `localhost` with your internal ip address.

   .. attention:: Ignore any warning given by your browser about "insecure website". This is due to the SSL certificate
      being self signed.

   .. caution:: If running for the first time, make sure to note the username and password that you created.

    #. Add games and applications.
    #. Adjust any configuration settings as needed.

#. In Moonlight, you may need to add the PC manually.
#. When Moonlight requests for you insert the pin:

   - Login to the web ui
   - Go to "PIN" in the Navbar
   - Type in your PIN and press Enter, you should get a Success Message
   - In Moonlight, select one of the Applications listed

Network
-------
The Sunshine user interface will be available on port 47990 by default.

.. warning:: Exposing ports to the internet can be dangerous. Do this at your own risk.

Arguments
---------
To get a list of available arguments run the following:

.. tab:: General

   .. code-block:: bash

      sunshine --help

.. tab:: AppImage

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./sunshine.AppImage --help

.. tab:: Flatpak

   .. code-block:: bash

      flatpak run --command=sunshine dev.lizardbyte.Sunshine --help

Shortcuts
---------
All shortcuts start with ``CTRL + ALT + SHIFT``, just like Moonlight

- ``CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + N`` - Hide/Unhide the cursor (This may be useful for Remote Desktop Mode for Moonlight)
- ``CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + F1/F12`` - Switch to different monitor for Streaming

Application List
----------------
- Applications should be configured via the web UI.
- A basic understanding of working directories and commands is required.
- You can use Environment variables in place of values
- ``$(HOME)`` will be replaced by the value of ``$HOME``
- ``$$`` will be replaced by ``$``, e.g. ``$$(HOME)`` will be become ``$(HOME)``
- ``env`` - Adds or overwrites Environment variables for the commands/applications run by Sunshine
- ``"Variable name":"Variable value"``
- ``apps`` - The list of applications
- Advanced users may want to edit the application list manually. The format is ``json``.
- Example ``json`` application:
   .. code-block:: json

      {
          "cmd": "command to open app",
          "detached": [
              "some-command",
              "another-command"
          ],
          "image-path": "/full-path/to/png-image",
          "name": "An App",
          "output": "/full-path/to/command-log-file",
          "prep-cmd": [
              {
                  "do": "some-command",
                  "undo": "undo-that-command"
              }
          ],
          "working-dir": "/full-path/to/working-directory"
      }

   - ``cmd`` - The main application
   - ``detached`` - A list of commands to be run and forgotten about

     - If not specified, a process is started that sleeps indefinitely

   - ``image-path`` - The full path to the cover art image to use.
   - ``name`` - The name of the application/game
   - ``output`` - The file where the output of the command is stored
   - ``auto-detach`` - Specifies whether the app should be treated as detached if it exits quickly
   - ``wait-all`` - Specifies whether to wait for all processes to terminate rather than just the initial process
   - ``exit-timeout`` - Specifies how long to wait in seconds for the process to gracefully exit (default: 5 seconds)
   - ``prep-cmd`` - A list of commands to be run before/after the application

     - If any of the prep-commands fail, starting the application is aborted
     - ``do`` - Run before the application

       - If it fails, all ``undo`` commands of the previously succeeded ``do`` commands are run

     - ``undo`` - Run after the application has terminated

       - Failures of ``undo`` commands are ignored

   - ``working-dir`` - The working directory to use. If not specified, Sunshine will use the application directory.

- For more examples see :ref:`app examples <about/guides/app_examples:app examples>`.

Considerations
--------------
- On Windows, Sunshine uses the Desktop Duplication API which only supports capturing from the GPU used for display.
  If you want to capture and encode on the eGPU, connect a display or HDMI dummy display dongle to it and run the games
  on that display.
- When an application is started, if there is an application already running, it will be terminated.
- When the application has been shutdown, the stream shuts down as well.

  - For example, if you attempt to run ``steam`` as a ``cmd`` instead of ``detached`` the stream will immediately fail.
    This is due to the method in which the steam process is executed. Other applications may behave similarly.
  - This does not apply to ``detached`` applications.

- The "Desktop" app works the same as any other application except it has no commands. It does not start an application,
  instead it simply starts a stream. If you removed it and would like to get it back, just add a new application with
  the name "Desktop" and "desktop.png" as the image path.
- For the Linux flatpak you must prepend commands with ``flatpak-spawn --host``.

HDR Support
-----------
Streaming HDR content is officially supported on Windows hosts and experimentally supported for Linux hosts.

- General HDR support information and requirements:

  - HDR must be activated in the host OS, which may require an HDR-capable display or EDID emulator dongle connected to your host PC.
  - You must also enable the HDR option in your Moonlight client settings, otherwise the stream will be SDR (and probably overexposed if your host is HDR).
  - A good HDR experience relies on proper HDR display calibration both in the OS and in game. HDR calibration can differ significantly between client and host displays.
  - You may also need to tune the brightness slider or HDR calibration options in game to the different HDR brightness capabilities of your client's display.
  - Some GPUs video encoders can produce lower image quality or encoding performance when streaming in HDR compared to SDR.

- Additional information:

.. tab:: Windows

     - HDR streaming is supported for Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA GPUs that support encoding HEVC Main 10 or AV1 10-bit profiles.
     - We recommend calibrating the display by streaming the Windows HDR Calibration app to your client device and saving an HDR calibration profile to use while streaming.
     - Older games that use NVIDIA-specific NVAPI HDR rather than native Windows HDR support may not display properly in HDR.

.. tab:: Linux

     - HDR streaming is supported for Intel and AMD GPUs that support encoding HEVC Main 10 or AV1 10-bit profiles using VAAPI.
     - The KMS capture backend is required for HDR capture. Other capture methods, like NvFBC or X11, do not support HDR.
     - You will need a desktop environment with a compositor that supports HDR rendering, such as Gamescope or KDE Plasma 6.
