# Building
Sunshine binaries are built using [CMake](https://cmake.org) and requires `cmake` > 3.25.

## Building Locally

### Compiler
It is recommended to use one of the following compilers:

| Compiler    | Version |
|:------------|:--------|
| GCC         | 14+     |
| Clang       | 17+     |
| Apple Clang | 15+     |

### Dependencies

#### FreeBSD
> [!CAUTION]
> Sunshine support for FreeBSD is experimental and may be incomplete or not work as expected

##### Install dependencies
```sh
pkg install -y \
  audio/opus \
  audio/pulseaudio \
  devel/cmake \
  devel/evdev-proto \
  devel/git \
  devel/libevdev \
  devel/libnotify \
  devel/ninja \
  devel/pkgconf \
  devel/qt6-base \
  ftp/curl \
  graphics/libdrm \
  graphics/qt6-svg \
  graphics/wayland \
  multimedia/libva \

  www/npm-node22 \
  x11/libX11 \
  x11/libxcb \
  x11/libXfixes \
  x11/libXrandr \
  x11/libXtst
```

#### Linux
Dependencies vary depending on the distribution. You can reference our
[linux_build.sh](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/blob/master/scripts/linux_build.sh) script for a list of
dependencies we use in Debian-based, Fedora-based and Arch-based distributions. Please submit a PR if you would like to extend the
script to support other distributions.

##### KMS Capture
If you are using KMS, patching the Sunshine binary with `setcap` is required. Some post-install scripts handle this. If building
from source and using the binary directly, this will also work:

```bash
sudo cp build/sunshine /tmp
sudo setcap cap_sys_admin,cap_sys_nice+p /tmp/sunshine
sudo getcap /tmp/sunshine
sudo mv /tmp/sunshine build/sunshine
```

##### CUDA Toolkit
Sunshine requires CUDA Toolkit for NVFBC capture. There are two caveats to CUDA:

1. The version installed depends on the version of GCC.
2. The version of CUDA you use will determine compatibility with various GPU generations.
   At the time of writing, the recommended version to use is CUDA ~13.1.
   See [CUDA compatibility](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html) for more info.

> [!NOTE]
> To install older versions, select the appropriate run file based on your desired CUDA version and architecture
> according to [CUDA Toolkit Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)

#### macOS
You can either use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) to install dependencies.

##### Homebrew
```bash
dependencies=(
  "boost"  # Optional
  "cmake"
  "doxygen"  # Optional, for docs
  "graphviz"  # Optional, for docs
  "icu4c"  # Optional, if boost is not installed
  "miniupnpc"
  "ninja"
  "node"
  "openssl@3"
  "opus"
  "pkg-config"
)
brew install "${dependencies[@]}"
```

If there are issues with an SSL header that is not found:

@tabs{
  @tab{ Intel | ```bash
    ln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/include/openssl /usr/local/include/openssl
    ```}
  @tab{ Apple Silicon | ```bash
    ln -s /opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/include/openssl /opt/homebrew/include/openssl
    ```
  }
}

##### MacPorts
```bash
dependencies=(
  "cmake"
  "curl"
  "doxygen"  # Optional, for docs
  "graphviz"  # Optional, for docs
  "libopus"
  "miniupnpc"
  "ninja"
  "npm9"
  "pkgconfig"
)
sudo port install "${dependencies[@]}"
```

#### Windows

> [!WARNING]
> Cross-compilation is not supported on Windows. You must build on the target architecture.

First, you need to install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org).

For AMD64 startup "MSYS2 UCRT64" (or for ARM64 startup "MSYS2 CLANGARM64") then execute the following commands.

##### Update all packages
```bash
pacman -Syu
```

##### Set toolchain variable
For UCRT64:
```bash
export TOOLCHAIN="ucrt-x86_64"
```

For CLANGARM64:
```bash
export TOOLCHAIN="clang-aarch64"
```

##### Install dependencies
```bash
dependencies=(
  "git"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-boost"  # Optional
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-cmake"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-cppwinrt"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-curl-winssl"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-doxygen"  # Optional, for docs... better to install official Doxygen
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-graphviz"  # Optional, for docs
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-miniupnpc"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-onevpl"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-openssl"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-opus"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-toolchain"
)
if [[ "${MSYSTEM}" == "UCRT64" ]]; then
  dependencies+=(
    "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-MinHook"
    "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-nodejs"
    "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-nsis"
  )
fi
pacman -S "${dependencies[@]}"
```

To create a WiX installer, you also need to install [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

For ARM64: To build frontend, you also need to install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### Clone
Ensure [git](https://git-scm.com) is installed on your system, then clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lizardbyte/sunshine.git --recurse-submodules
cd sunshine
mkdir build
```

### Build

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja -S .
ninja -C build
```

> [!TIP]
> Available build options can be found in
> [options.cmake](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/blob/master/cmake/prep/options.cmake).

### macOS code signing & entitlements
The macOS virtual gamepad publishes a virtual HID device via `IOHIDUserDeviceCreate`,
which requires the `com.apple.developer.hid.virtual.device` entitlement. Builds that
don't carry it (Homebrew, unsigned PR/CI builds) still run normally — `IOHIDUserDeviceCreate`
fails, the gamepad is simply unavailable, and the rest of Sunshine is unaffected. AMFI only
terminates Sunshine when a build *declares* this restricted entitlement under a signature
that isn't authorized to use it (see below).

The entitlements are defined in `src_assets/macos/build/sunshine.entitlements` and are
applied automatically when the `.app` is signed (when `SHOULD_SIGN=true`).

This is an Apple-**restricted** entitlement, which has two consequences:

- **Official / distributed builds:** the Developer ID signing identity must be authorized
  by Apple for this entitlement, otherwise notarization (and AMFI at runtime) will reject
  the build.
- **Local development (ad-hoc signed) builds:** ad-hoc signatures are not trusted to carry
  restricted entitlements, so AMFI will still kill the process. To test the gamepad locally,
  first sign the built `.app` with the entitlements:
  ```bash
  codesign --force --deep --sign - \
    --entitlements src_assets/macos/build/sunshine.entitlements \
    ./build/Sunshine.app
  ```
  Then relax AMFI enforcement so the ad-hoc binary is allowed to use the restricted
  entitlement. AMFI is controlled by the `amfi_get_out_of_my_way=0x1` boot argument (there is
  no `csrutil` switch for it), and setting boot arguments requires SIP to be disabled. **This
  weakens system security and is intended for development machines only.**

  - **Intel:** boot into Recovery (⌘-R), open Terminal, then:
    ```bash
    csrutil disable
    nvram boot-args="amfi_get_out_of_my_way=0x1"
    ```
    Reboot back into macOS.
  - **Apple Silicon:** boot into Recovery (hold the power button), set the startup disk to
    *Reduced Security* with *"Allow user management of kernel extensions"* via Startup Security
    Utility, then from a Recovery Terminal:
    ```bash
    csrutil disable
    bputil -k    # follow the prompts to allow boot-args
    nvram boot-args="amfi_get_out_of_my_way=0x1"
    ```
    Reboot back into macOS. (Exact steps vary by macOS version — consult Apple's current
    Startup Security Utility documentation.)

  When you are done developing, **revert these changes**: clear the boot argument
  (`sudo nvram -d boot-args`) and re-enable SIP from Recovery with `csrutil enable` (and
  restore *Full Security* on Apple Silicon).

### Remote Build
It may be beneficial to build remotely in some cases. This will enable easier building on different operating systems.

1. Fork the project
2. Activate workflows
3. Trigger the *CI* workflow manually
4. Download the artifacts/binaries from the workflow run summary
